# Catch all email address at Zoho

I decided to set one of these up.

	Control Panel > Mail Administration > Org Settings

	"Catch all" tab.

I had to create the account first.

In the "Catch all address" you put the complete email address including the domain (even though you've specified the domain in a drop down above)
