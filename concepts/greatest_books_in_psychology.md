# "50 Psychology Classics: the Greatest Books in Psychology"

I listened to the audiobook of "50 Psychology Classics" by Tom Butler-Bowdon. It's quite detailed and does a good job distilling so much information down.

Here's a list of the books in chronological order, (though in the book they are ordered alphabetical by author's surname. I'd prefer chronological ascending as earlier books tend to influence later and seldom vice versa)
