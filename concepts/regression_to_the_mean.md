# Regression to the mean

Had a fantastic start to the day? 

Don't worry the rest of the day will be less fantastic.

Had a terrible horrible no-good entirely tragic start to the year? 

Don't worry the rest of the year will be less terrible.

It's not the universe "making up for things" it's just what the pundits call [regression to the mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_toward_the_mean)

Read "thinking fast and slow" by Daniel Kahneman to learn a lot more about this.
