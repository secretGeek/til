# Narcissism of small differences

> it is precisely communities with adjoining territories and close relationships that engage in constant feuds and mutual ridicule because of hypersensitivity to details of differentiation

For example, because Java and C# are so similar, their users are more likely to feud, not less.

At a smaller scale: tabs and spaces make no difference to a running program, so proponents are each are the most likely to feud.

Same for brace positioning. 

People pour effort into these things because they are a way of asserting their individuality.
