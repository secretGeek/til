# Paint.Net Layers

There's only one secret to mastering Paint.Net. 

Put everything in a separate layer. 

For example:

 * Every part of a drawing/diagram should have its own layer.
 * Before applying an effect to a layer -- clone the layer, and hide the original. 

Get very comfortable with all the layer related features:

 * New layer
 * Clone layer
 * Delete layer
 * Move Layer Up
 * Move Layer Down
 * Edit the transparency of a layer
 * Switch a layer on/off
 * Paste in to new layer
 
Save the file as a .pdn file, and export copies as .png.
