# Edit icon online

It seems I've used pretty much all the icon editors. Some online some downloadable.

 * <http://www.xiconeditor.com/> Let's you edit each size of the imagine online with rudimentary pixel tools. You can upload frames.
 
    Frame sizes are 16x16, 24x24, 32x32 and 64x64. This isn't enough for an application icon.


 * <https://icoconvert.com/> Let's you upload multiple pngs to create one ico.
 
What is the right settings for a windows 7+ icon? 
    What sizes? 
        16x16 yes
        24x24 (classic only)
        32x32 yes
        48x48 yes
        64x64 (classic only)
        96x96 (vista?)
        256x256 yes (not in classic)
    What color depth?

Answer:

> Application icons and Control Panel items: The full set includes 16x16, 32x32, 48x48, and 256x256 (code scales between 32 and 256). The .ico file format is required.

> For Classic Mode, the full set is 16x16, 24x24, 32x32, 48x48 and 64x64.
