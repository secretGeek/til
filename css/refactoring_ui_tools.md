Excellent talk, helps show the thinking process a professional designer uses when improving a site. 

I learned a lot from it and hope you will too.

Here are all the links or tools mentioned. Watch the talk though!

   - use dribbble's colour search to find sites using colours you like, and its palette for a picture
* Colour palettes from Tailwind - [Tailwind css palette](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors/#default-color-palette)

   - [contraste app](https://contrasteapp.com) &mdash; MacOS only... otherwise use: 
   - [webaim contrast checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)
* SVG background patterns - [hero patterns](http://www.heropatterns.com/)  also, it advertises [Heroicons](http://www.heroicons.com/) (see also <https://github.com/sschoger/heroicons-ui>) for icons

One particular tip that is a real standout:

    font-feature-settings: "tnum";
