# Why we Sleep Dr Matt Walker



Melatonin rises after dark before bed. It falls when we wake at dawn and lowers from regular light/dark cycles (particularly blue light)


Adenosine - keeps rising until we sleep. Caffeine interferes with it. An evening nap clears some out and makes it hard to sleep later.


## Sleep hygiene

1. reduce caffeine intake
2. reduce alcohol intake
3. remove screen technology from bedroom
4. reduce bedroom temperature (may involve lighter nightwear and bedding)



Establish regular bedtime - even on weekends

Go to bed only when sleepy

Avoid early mid evening naps (Eg on couch)

Never lie in bed awake for a significant time period



If having difficulty sleeping at night avoid daytime napping



Learn to mentally decelerate before bed to reduce night time anxiety provoking thoughts



Remove visible clock faces from bedroom (can create clock watching anxiety)



Finish workouts at least 2 to 3 hours before sleep.



Exercise will generally improve sleep. Sleep will powerfully improve exercise.
