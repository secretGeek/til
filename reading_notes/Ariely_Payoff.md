# Payoff: the hidden logic that shapes our motivations Dan Ariely





Life calling, things larger than ourselves.



People are more motivated when you acknowledge their work.



People overvalue their own output (ie compared to how others value it) "egocentric bias"



People care more when they can put their name on something.



People value their output relative to the effort they've put in.



People are demotivated when their output is destroyed before their eyes.



People are demotivated when their output is ignored.
