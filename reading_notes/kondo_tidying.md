# The life changing magic of tidying - Marie Kondo



Do one category at a time - not one place.

Do the category completely and perfectly, not partially or imperfectly.



In addition to monetary value, items have 3 types of value



Function
Information
Emotional attachment


Best category order to approach:



Clothes
Books
Papers
Miscellanies
Kimono
Sentimental and keepsakes
