# Zen and the Art of motorcycle Maintenance

U can mix story with lecture.

We did this and I am reminded that. No real link between them.

Include suspense though (across the story parts "at moment, Chris has noticed something.", and/or across the lecture sections... "tomorrow we'll see more about that...").
