# Sweet spot - Christine Carer


Referring to habits as being like a tiny rider on top of an elephant. The rider is your consciousness brain trying to influence the elephant. And the elephant is your habits, your instincts, your unconscious automatic mind.

Comes from psychologist Jonathan Haidt in the Happiness Hypothesis.

Chip and Dan Heath cover it in 'Switch'

3 big scarcity lies taught by our culture:

Lynne twist in. The soul of money

More is better

There isn't enough

It's just the way it is and I don't have the power to change it.



Most people chase after:

* Money
* Fame
* Sex
* Power
* Prestige
* Eternal youth
* Happiness and
* Success


We're not best motivated by those and they don't bring satisfaction when they are achieved.



We are best motivated by our significance to other people. By believing that our work makes a difference for other people.



Beliefs are powerful. Example of mindset. Example of placebo medications.



Meaning is an inside job.



Don't work on your resume - work on your eulogy.
