# Spaced Repetition software

on iOS I use an app called "CleverDeck"

I've even put sight-words and dolce-words in there for my youngest child to learn from (she's learning to read)

Another child has a copy of clever deck she used for finally solidifying her knowledge of the "times tables" she couldn't quite get clear in her mind. 7*8, 11*12, and a few like that.

With clever deck you can quickly add your own cards.

A single fact may be best represented by more than 3 cards:

 - word &#x21B7; definition
 - definition &#x21B7; word
 - example with word missing &#x21B7; example with word filled in. (note: this is called cloze deletion)

## Topics to gather

* Basic strategy for 21
* Birthdays of people I know
* Children's (and pet's) names of friends
* Bash commands
* Ubuntu paths
* Guitar chords

* git commands
