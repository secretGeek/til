# ConsoleZ as a replacement over Console2.

    choco install consoleZ
    
(after first running as admin)    

Here's where I run console (Console2) from:

    $env:util\Console.exe

Here's where choco installed ConsoleZ

    C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\lib\ConsoleZ\tools\console.exe

//TODO: How can I best put consoleZ into my path (across all machines)? i need it for when i "[runas](../powershell/runas.md)"
