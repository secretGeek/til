# Sleep Terminology

Regarding the title [Getting to Sleep and Staying Asleep](Getting_to_sleep_and_staying_asleep.md) article, there's some related terminology I want to record while I recall it.

"Getting to sleep" is referred to as "sleep onset." If you have trouble getting to sleep, a specialist would say you have "delayed sleep onset."

"Staying asleep" is referred to as "maintaining sleep." If you wake up and can't get back to sleep you have trouble with "sleep maintenance."
