# Auto Insert close tag

When I type &lt;p&gt; and it automatically inserts &lt;/p&gt; .... I find that strangely annoying...

Probably because that is only helpful if you write in a linear manner, from beginning to end... and I rarely do that.

I spend more time editing any file than I do writing it the first time.

So -- to turn off that behavior:

go to:

> Tools | Options | Text Editor | HTML | Formatting

Under:

> "Automatic formatting options"

> "Auto Insert close tag" &larr; uncheck that!!
