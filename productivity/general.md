# General parts of a productivity system

* usable from desktop
* usable from mobile
* usable from multiple desktops
* preferably works on desktop when offline
* preferably works on mobile when offline
* data survives long term - outlasts the system
* minimal effort required to capture tasks
* should be long term usable - not just a burst of initial use
* shouldn't overwhelm you once you've been using it for (say) 5 years
* shouldn't be overhwhelming if you step away for (say) a year, and then return



Lots of different needs overlap in a productivity system:

* calendar items
* notes/records (for this i use TIL)
* journal (for this I use a digitial journal)
* projects
* TODOs
* prioritizing
* team management
* recurring items
* deadlines
* customer relationship
* shopping lists
* sharing some lists with other people 
* kanban / visible card / limits
* things to remember (memorization)


I currently use a mix of things:

* CleverDeck to memorize things
* TIL for things I need to know but not memorize (that are public)
* KV for snippets I need to re-use (not well shared across machines though)
* Password manager for passwords and the like
* Journal file for working memory with "today" command to bring in current calculated daily items
* "markjump" manages links to the folder of each project I'm working on
* ".ok" file manages commands relevant for that projects, e.g. opening a relevant todo.txt file (or TFS as the case may be, on a project by project basis)
* Pocket for things to read later (automatically synced to Kobo)
* "util" repo for keeping scripts/tools/profile, & TIL itself, synced across machines
* dropbox 
* Things I find interesting are written in wiki.secretgeek.net
* contacts (scattered)
* Plan file - collapsible plain text with .html extension, for capturing long term plans/ideas/notes on any project. single file. 

The most fundamental concepts of productivity are

* managing your commitments (avoid being overcommitted, know when to say no)
* prioritization
* capture of ideas
* habits (good habits, bad habits)
