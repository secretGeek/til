# How to download a custom daterange from paypal

When you want to download a custom daterange from paypal, you might think that the "reports" tab is what you're after... but you would be wrong!

What you're after is the activity tab. (currently <https://www.paypal.com/businessexp/transactions>)

And hit "download" straight away (currently <https://business.paypal.com/merchantdata/reportHome?reportType=DLOG>)

(Don't even bother entering the date range before you press download because it won't be remembered by the download page)

For "format": You'll want CSV not TSV, by the way. Because Excel.

And for a financial year you'll want, for example: 1/07/2016 - 30/06/2017


If the transaction history is big enough then they email you when it's ready and it's available from:

https://business.paypal.com/merchantdata/reportHome?reportType=DLOG

Previously it was:
